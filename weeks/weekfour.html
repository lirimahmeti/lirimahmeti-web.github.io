    <h1>Selectors</h1>
    <p>In this week we learned a little bit about css and how it is the key to give webpages style, colors, layots and make them visually appealing to our eyes. <br>
    We were told to think about html as being the bones of a webpage (structure), and css as being the skin, clothes and the rest of the things that make a website visually better.</p> <p>this is the second paragraph and it will not be affected by css if i use the + selector. <br>But if i want all of the paragraph that come after the h1 to be affected by css
        i can use the ~ selector!</p>

    <p>This is another test paragraph which it contains a span tag <span>here</span> and another span here inside a bold tag <b><span>here2</span></b><br>
    in these example only the first and direct child of p which is the kind of span will be affected by css by using the > selector! <br>
If i want to affect any span that is inside a paragraph without taking in consideration of how they are nested i can just do this: p span. This will affect all of spans inside paragraphs.</p>
        <h3>This is a test text and i think it looks cool</h3>
