    <h1>Lirim Ahmeti</h1>
    <p>This website has been created to document and follow every step of my journey of becoming a full stack web developer.</p>
    <h2><b>How will this work?</b></h2>
    <p>I will come to this website and update it everytime that i have learned something new from my online course. 
        <b>I will be keeping the old versions of this Home Page</b> down at the <a href="#buttoni">Older Versions</a> button. Also i will make a list of the weeks
    and put there all of my knowledge and see how i progress from a complete beginner to a pro :)</p>
